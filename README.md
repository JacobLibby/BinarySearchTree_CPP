# BinarySearchTree_CPP


<b>INPUT</b>: User inputs an array size and its contents (doubles) and then is prompted by a menu.
            The user then, through the console enters integers 1-5 corresponding to different functions.

<b>OUTPUT</b>: Prompts are printed to the console for the user to enter array size and contents,
            followed by a menu with different options for the user to insert, remove, print, or sort
            elements of the array, or to exit.
            
<b>SUMMARY</b>: The user inputted array size and array are manipulated through user input.
            The user may select to insert a new value, remove a pre-existing one, print the array,
            sort the array, or exit the program.
            
<b>RUNNING</b>: Begin by navigating to the project in your terminal of choice and create an executable from all files.

```
gcc driver.cpp BST.h BST.cpp -o driver.exe
```

*NOTE, ```gcc``` in this example corresponds to the GNU Compiler Collection, which is the compiler I use for compiling my C++ programs. If using an alternative compiler, follow that compiler's documentation and you should arrive at the same results.*

Next, run the executable file from the terminal.
```
driver.exe
```

The code then will run. Feel free to tinker around with the code and remember to recompile a new executable and rerun the executable in order to see all changes.
